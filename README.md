# fumosay
fumosay is like the classic cowsay, but featuring funky fumos, written in C.

Modifying the original introduction:
```
It operates less than the figlet program does, and it is written in the spirit of funkyness.
```

## Features
- cowsay  
  Right now, it's just like cowsay, but worse. More features to be added that hopefully makes it at least as good as the original, which is 24 years old now.
- fumos  
  This first version contains two fumos, Reimu and Patchouli. More will come to grace your terminals, but they take quite a while to draw.

## Updates
More or less frequent updates. See [changelog](changelog.md).

Have fun.
